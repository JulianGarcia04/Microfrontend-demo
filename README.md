# Conclusion
Module federation plugin in differents frameworks such us Vue, react; or frameworks hardest such us Quasar or NextJS
module federation dont work and I undertand because microfrontend architecture has a usecase with context in where the differents
projects has a differents version to the same framework is a myth that you use the microfroends architecture with different frameworks
or in this case module federation plugin, because module federation plugin is only in webpack 5 and is obviously that the differents
version to framework work with differents webpack version and some frameworks is adapted for work with a webpack version in specfic
such us case quasar that in his version one work and only work with webpack 4 then dont use module federation plugin.
Only i could run the module federation in projects with equals versions in this using quasar v2. In this the folder name of each one
of projects is "dashboard" and "checkout".

My conclusion can change because i am starting in the microfrontends world, this is my first conclusion i going to test with others 
microfrontends frameworks such us single spa, systemJS or bit
